# Ionic-Automatic-Mac-Installer

If you do not know how to install Ionics in your Macintosh in the Terminal (or in the Command Prompt). This automate batch file will install the the "software" for youwithout typing any codes.


STEP 1: 

Download the lastest Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/

STEP 2: 
Unzip and open  "ionic_installer.zip" file. This will automatically create a directory named "Ionic_Projects" in your Documents folder.

STEP 3: 
Double click the "Create_Ionic_Project" file. 

A dialog prompt will ask you for the name of your project. 




Wait for the file to execute the commands in the terminal. (Yes, you won't be doing anything at this stage)


After the file executes the commands, your default browser now will automatically open a blank Ionic Project. 



Your project is saved at the following folder: ~Documents\Ionic_Projects\Your_Project_Name.




Start editing coding your project. For beginners, you may begin reading the documentation here:

https://ionicframework.com/docs/components/#alert

Try typing the provided code from the documentation under ~Your_Project_Name\src\pages\home\home.html and see what happens to your blank Ionic Project in the browser




NOTE: 

This is STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS. I am will be soon working (when I'm not busy) on an automatic batch file where users can build and publish their projects in Android, iOS, and Windows But feel free to fork ahead!
