Wait for the file to execute the commands in the terminal. (Yes, you won't be doing anything at this stage. Simply wait for this scary Terminal window to finish it tasks)

Start editing coding your project. For beginners, you may begin reading the Ionic documentation here:

https://ionicframework.com/docs/components/#alert

Try typing the provided code from the Ionic documentation under ~Your_Project_Name\src\pages\home\home.html and see what happens to your blank Ionic Project in the browser




<h3>NOTE: </h3>

This is STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS. I am will be soon working (when I'm not busy) on an automatic batch file where users can build and publish their projects in Android, iOS, and Windows But feel free to fork ahead!
